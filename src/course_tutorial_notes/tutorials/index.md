# Tutorials

These are one-off tutorials about various topics that I have found it helpful to record notes from. Unlike courses that are typically series of articles or videos that fully overview some topic or technology, these tutorials are more specific in their topical focus and thus my notes will be equally constrained.
As with my notes on courses, these are intended mostly for internal reference by me and while I hope that they can be helpful to others, may be abbreviated or not complete in their explanations due to the intended audience's idiosyncratic understandings of the various topics contained and surrounding context.
