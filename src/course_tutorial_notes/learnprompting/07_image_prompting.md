# 07. Image Prompting

## Introduction

- iterative and research heavy process to make images consistently according to a specific style using LLM image generators
- below are some means and techniques for getting desired results from such prompts

## Style Modifiers

- information about artists, styles, etc to get specific styles such as `rendered with unity`, `made of glass`, `art by Leandardo DeVinci`
- `photorealistic, by greg rutkowski, by christopher nolan, painting, digital painting, concept art, octane render, wide lens, 3D render, cinematic lighting, trending on ArtStation, trending on CGSociety, hyper realist, photo, natural light, film grain`

## Quality Boosters

- terms added to a prompt to improve certain non-style-specific qualities of the generated image.
- `High resolution, 2K, 4K, 8K, clear, good lighting, detailed, extremely detailed, sharp focus, intricate, beautiful, realistic+++, complementary colors, high quality, hyper detailed, masterpiece, best quality, artstation, stunning`

## Repetition

- using the same word repeatedly (like `very, very, very`) to improve appearance

## Weighted Terms

- providing relative measures following a colon (positive or negative) that provide emphasis to the image generator
- a useful means of creating textual separation is the pipe symbol "|"

## Fix Deformed Generators

- image artifacts do often appear, negative prompts help mitigate this
  - these can also be weighted
  - the model is highly influential on the amounts of artifacts generated.

## Shot Type

- shot type here refers to the shot in its photography meaning (the angle and perspective of the image)
