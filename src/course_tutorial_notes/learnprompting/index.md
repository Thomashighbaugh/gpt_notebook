### How To Read

- Material can be taken in any order
  - those new to the subject should probably start with the Basic lesson
- Color coded article difficult rating system
  - green: beginner friendly
  - yellow: easy, requires basic programming knowledge
  - red: intermediate, requires programming and domain knowledge (aka related concepts from Math, easily explained by ChatGPT! ;])
  - purple:advanced, in-depth programming and domain knowledge

### Chapters

Each page of notes listed under this course under its hierarchy corresponds to one of the chapters of the course. Chapters are split into several individual articles and in some cases, may be split into multiple notes. To keep a logical paradigm of organization in maintaining these notes, each chapter will have its own directory and if subsequent notes are needed or desirable, they will correspond to an article within a chapter and be located in subdirectory of the chapter they are derived from. Below is a table enumerating each chapter and introducing its content in a very broad stroke.
