# Course and Tutorial Notes

The notes listed under this topic have been generated during (and titled after) my utilization of various courses and tutorials related to prompt engineering, machine learning, generative AI and other associated technologies in an effort to better understand these technologies and realize their potential benefits both personally and professionally.

Being of extremely limited means at the time of writing, the courses and tutorials I am able to engage with are entirely free and publicly accessible, links to the material will be included with the notes themselves in the pages underneath this one for those interested in utilizing the courses or tutorials as part of their own learning processes.
