# Roadmap: Prompt Engineering

Course Link: [Roadmap: Prompt Engineering](https://roadmap.sh/prompt-engineering)

This course takes the form of an interactive mind-map with links to resources related to each of its elements. These elements offer additional information about the subject heading, obviously, but provide a graphical and topical means of organizing a collection of notes that is not simply heirarchical but also enables the various ways that topics in the subject relate be evident in a visibly appreciable manner. This is a fresh approach and the resources seem good so I have opted to take this course as a means of further polishing my prompt engineering knowledge and as a test of the platform which I may utilize for other subjects in the future.

I am tempted to use a product like [AnyType.io](https://anytype.io) to record the notes in a mindmap replicating that of which one uses to navigate the course, but for now an `ad hoc` grouping of these notes available under this topic in this notebook shall have to suffice.
